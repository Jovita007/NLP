# NLP

Posting feedback based on personal experience has recently become a common way for people to express their thoughts.This paper's main emphasis is on the college evaluation, and our main goal is to use sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a powerful method for better understanding a given evaluation, whether positive or negative. To determine whether a given review is positive or negative, we used Naive bayes, Random forest, and Support vector classifiers. Python is used to implement the proposed machine learning classifier algorithms
